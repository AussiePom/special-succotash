<h1> computer parts </h1>
<p> computers are made up of may different types of things </p>
<h2> A computer system typically consists of several common components, including the: </h2>


<p> Central Processing Unit (CPU): This is the “brain” of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. </p>

<p> Memory (RAM): Random Access Memory is used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs quickly. </p>

<p> Storage: This includes both the hard drive for long-term storage of data and the solid-state drive (SSD) for faster access to data. </p>

<p> Motherboard: This is the main circuit board that connects all the components of the computer together. </p>

<p> Input and Output Devices: These include devices like keyboards, the mouse, monitors, and printers that allow users to interact with the computer. </p>

<p> Power Supply: This component provides electrical power to the computer. </p>

<p> Operating System: This is the software that manages the computer’s resources and provides an interface for users and applications.</p>

<p> Peripheral Devices: These include devices such as external drives, scanners, and webcams that can be connected to the computer to expand its capabilities. </p>


<h2> All computer hardware can be categorised into one of four types: </h2>

<p> Input devices (i.e. those through which data enters the computer system) – for example, keyboards, microphones, tablets, touch screens, scanners, and the mouse </p>

<p> Output devices (i.e. those through which data leaves the computer system) – for example, monitors, speakers, and printers </p>

<p> Processing devices (i.e. those that organise data to be produce information) and control devices (i.e. those that coordinate the different devices in the system) – for example, the central processing unit, control unit, motherboard, and system clock </p>

<p> Storage devices (i.e. those that store information) – for example, hard drives, RAM and ROM, CDs, DVDs, floppy discs, and USBs </p>

<h2> Types of input devices: </h2>

<p> Keyboards </p>
<p> Joysticks </p>
<p> The mouse </p>
<p> Trackpads </p
<p> Microphones </p>
<p> Barcode readers </p>
<p> Tablets </p>
<p> Scanners </p>
<p> Touch screens </p>

<h2> what input devices do </h2>
<p> An input device is connected to computers to accept data from users. </p>
<p> Input devices are controlled by the user. </p>
<p> Input devices translate user friendly inputs to machine understandable inputs. </p>


<h2> Types of output devices: </h2>

<p> Monitors </p>
<p> Speakers </p>
<p> Printers </p>
<p> and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p> (thats alot of exclamtion marks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) </p>

<h2> what output devices do </h2>

<p> An output device is connected to computers to provide data to users. </p>

<p> Output devices are controlled by the computer </p>

<p> Output devices translate machine friendly outputs to user understandable outputs. </p>

<h2> control and processing devices include: </h2>

<p> The central processing unit </p>
<p> The motherboard </p>
<p> The control unit </p>
<p> The parallel port </p>
<p> The arithmetic logic unit </p>
<p> The serial port </p>
<p> Registers </p>
<p> Expansion cards </p>
<p> The system clock </p>

<h2> processing devices are those that organise data to be produce information. </h2>
<h2> control devices are those that coordinate the different devices in the system. </h2>

<p> Whenever a program instruction is carried out by a computer, a sequence of events called the fetch-execute cycle (also known as the “machine cycle”) will commence. This is the main way in which calculations and decisions are made within the computer system. </p>

<p> This cycle involves both the control and processing devices; however, that’s not to say the other components of “the bus” are not also involved. </p>


<h2> storage devices are those that store information. Examples of storage devices include: </h2>

<p> Random access memory (RAM) </p>
<p> CD ROMs </p>
<p> Read only memory (ROM) </p>
<p> DVDs </p>
<p> Hard drives </p>
<p> USBs </p>
<p> Floppy discs </p>
<p> There are two main types of storage devices: primary (which are only able to store information when the computer system is on) and secondary (which can store information when the computer system is off). </p>


<h2> computer software can be categorised into three main types: </h2>

<h3> System software - a type of software that is directly involved with the operation of the computer (i.e. the computer’s operating system), which can be further divided into the following sub-types: </h3>

<p> General purpose operating systems (which run a variety of different programs) </p>
<p> Dedicated operating systems (which run a single program or perform one specific purpose) </p>
<p> Single-user operating systems (where one user accesses the system at one time) </p>
<p> Multi-user operating systems (where multiple users access the system at one time) </p>
<p> Multi-tasking operating systems (where multiple programs can be operated at once) </p>

<h3> Application software – a software program that performs a specific function (e.g. word processors, web browsers, database programs, image editors, and paint or drawing programs) </h3>

<h3> Utility software – a type of software that performs a task associated with the operation of the computer system (e.g. anti-virus and internet security programs) </h3>


<h2> Algorithms are detailed sequences of actions that are used to write programs for computers. </h2> 

<p> Essentially, these algorithms provide the computer with instructions, so that it knows what it needs to do. </p>


<h3> All algorithms consist of three elements: </h3>

<p> The sequence (i.e. the series of steps that need to be followed) </p>
<p> The decision (i.e. a series of questions that work towards a particular outcome) </p>
<p> Repetition (i.e. a particular action that happens over and over again) </p>
